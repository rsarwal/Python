# DataForSEO Keyword Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of the DataForSEO API to retrieve historical rank overview data for a specific website. It showcases skills in API integration, data retrieval, and Python programming.

## Project Overview

The script connects to the DataForSEO API to fetch historical ranking data for the website "lovepop.com" in the United States market, covering the period from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022. This data provides insights into the website's organic and paid search performance over time.

## Key Features

- API authentication and connection
- Data retrieval using POST requests
- Parsing and handling of JSON responses
- Error handling for API requests

## Code Structure

The main components of the code include:

1. A `RestClient` class for handling API connections and requests
2. Configuration of API credentials (stored separately for security)
3. Setting up the request parameters for the historical rank overview
4. Sending the POST request to the DataForSEO API
5. Processing and displaying the response data

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- API integration
- JSON data handling
- Secure credential management
- Data analysis and interpretation

## Usage

To use this script, you need to have valid DataForSEO API credentials. These should be stored in a separate `config.py` file for security reasons.

```python
from config import API_USERNAME, API_PASSWORD
```

## Results

The script retrieves comprehensive ranking data, including:

- Organic and paid search positions
- Estimated traffic value (ETV)
- Impression data
- Keyword counts and movements (new, up, down, lost)

This data can be further analyzed to gain insights into the website's SEO performance and trends over time.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to this project could include:

1. Data visualization of the ranking trends
2. Integration with data storage solutions for historical analysis
3. Automated reporting functionality
4. Expansion to analyze multiple websites or competitors
